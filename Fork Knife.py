"Development" started 12-23-21

Ideas and to do list:
Metal, wood, brocks, some more rare and weaker/stronger than others

v1 has very basic handling of damage, its simple and not dynamic. v2 should have
things like armor pen depending on the weapon, damage falloff due to distance, ect

add resistance potion. wears off after a certain amount of turns

make the first 2 turns always find stuff
add a difficulty option. would change things like weapon damage and enemy health
add colored text

BUG
Bugs:
Sheilds can go past 100. do some math to check if sheilds will go over 100. if they do,
just make the sheilds 100

you can just spam enter to win, impliment a check to make sure an action is taken before a turn is advanced
things to make sure to keep constant for this are: turn count, player count. everything else only changes
after a turn is taken

inventory is a general mess. see if it can be displayed with for loops insteal of har coding it
